From ideas:

# Spotify Advanced Search

I am trying to find a song that I listened to 2 days ago. I have no idea if it was in my liked songs, I don't know what it was called or who the artist is. I would like to use the API to search through my most recently listened to. I would also like to be able to use the tags that I know these songs have to narrow it down i.e. 'instrumental'. Some other data such as how many times I had listened to the song would be useful. I'm sure you could get hyper advanced with white lists and black lists too. This would be an interesting project.

# Last X months playlists

Adding to this, I think it would be neat to create a playlist that was just the last X months of my spotify liked songs and have it constantly update. It would be nice to shuffle this. I feel like a lot gets lost.
